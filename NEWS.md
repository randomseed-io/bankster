# History of bankster releases

## 1.1.0 (2021-03-25)

- Added currency/update for updating currencies with additional data preservation
  (localized properties, countries, etc.).
- Added money/cast for casting monetary amounts across currencies
  (different or slightly different, e.g. sourced in another registries).
- Added scale/to-clojure-string, scale/to-symbol, scale/to-clojure-symbol.
- Added money/->symbol, money/->clojure-symbol, money/->double, money/->float.
- Improved money/value to be more polymorphic (currency argument).
- Improved conversion functions: scale/->int, scale/->long, scale/->float, scale/->double.
- Type hinting improved in multiple functions and protocol methods.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

- Conversion functions now have different arities:
  scale/->int, scale/->long, scale/->float, scale/->double.
- Function scale/to-plain-string is now converting decimals to plain strings
  without adding M suffix when there is too many digits. This functionality
  was moved to scale/to-clojure-string.

## 1.0.8 (2021-03-23)

- Function money/convert now accepts aÂ price and is more polymorphic.
- Added the function currency/localized-properties.

## 1.0.7 (2021-03-19)

- Improved and unified rescaling of Money objects when their currency is auto-scaled.
- Functions money/amount, money/stripped-amount and money/currency are now polymorphic.
- Currencies database updated.

## 1.0.6 (2021-03-19)

- Better printing of monetary amounts of big precisions (adding M letter to a number).
- Better parsing of monetary amounts of big precisions (early conversion to big decimals to avoid scientific notation).

## 1.0.5 (2021-03-18)

- Fixed a bug reversing order of weighted currencies.

## 1.0.4 (2021-03-18)

- Added missing Monetary implementation functions for Money.
- Improved currency/id Monetary implementation to support currency codes.

## 1.0.3 (2021-03-17)

- Fixed a bug that caused wrong locale detection on some environments,
  caused by redundant localized properties preparation (double parsing
  of locale object initially expressed with a keyword).

## 1.0.2 (2021-03-16)

- Currency codes are now default fallback identifiers of registered currencies.
- Fixed (re-)setting of localized properties during currency registering.

## 1.0.1 (2021-03-15)

- Removed accidental databases from the resources.

## 1.0.0 (2021-03-15)

- Initial release.
