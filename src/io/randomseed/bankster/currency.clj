  "Gets the localized property of a currency from the given registry and locale. If the
  registry is not given, the global one will be used. If the locale is not given, the
  default locale for the environment will be used. Locale can be expressed as a
  Locale object or any object which can be used to identify the locale (e.g. a keyword
  or a string).

  Localized properties are maps keyed by currency identifiers, containing another
  maps keyed by locale objects. There is a special key :* which identifies default
  properties used when there are no properties in locale-keyed maps.

  Let's take a hypothetical entry of a registry database `.cur-id->localized`:

  ```clojure
  {:XXX {#object[java.util.Locale 0x3f5af72f \"en_US\"] {:symbol \"$\"}}
        {#object[java.util.Locale 0x3f5af72f \"en\"]    {:symbol \"X$\"}
        {:* {:symbol \"ABC\"}}
  ```

  * Calling `(localized-property :symbol :XXX :en_US)` will return `$`.
  * Calling `(localized-property :symbol :XXX :en_GB)` will return `X$`.
  * Calling `(localized-property :symbol :XXX :pl_PL)` will return `ABC`.

  The first is self-explanatory.

  The second falls back to `en` because the function will re-try the language
  part (`en`) alone when the property was not found. The same method is repeatedly
  applied to other components of a locale (variant, script and extensionsÂ â€“ if
  any). So for the locale identified by `th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai` the following keys will
  be tried:

  - `th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai`,
  - `th_TH_TH_#u-nu`,
  - `th_TH_TH_#u`,
  - `th_TH_TH`,
  - `th_TH` and `th`.

  The third example renders `ABC` because there is an entry of `:symbol` in the
  default properties map under the key `:*`.

  Please note that functions for getting particular properties may apply additional
  steps to obtain them. For instance, the display-name function will first call the
  localized-property and if it fails it will fall back to Java methods (if the
  currency is ISO-standardized). If that will fail too then it will return a currency
  code."

  "Returns a currency formatter as java.text.DecimalFormat instance for the given
  currency, customizable with the given opts map. If the locale is not given then the
  default one will be used. Due to caching strategy it is advised to express locale
  with a keyword.

  The formatter is a mutable clone of Java data structure.

  In case of currencies other than ISO-standardized (and predefined in Java) the
  currency field of this formatter will be set to the currency of XXX.

  Options map can have the following keys:

  - :rounding-mode   - RoundingMode, rounding mode to apply when scaling
  - :grouping        - Boolean, if true then grouping will be used
  - :grouping-size   - integer, size of a group when grouping
  - :negative-prefix - String, negative prefix to use
  - :negative-suffix - String, negative suffix to use
  - :positive-prefix - String, positive prefix to use
  - :positive-suffix - String, positive suffix to use
  - :always-sep-dec  - Boolean, if true then the decimal separator will always be shown
  - :currency-symbol-fn  - a function used on a bankster/Currency object to get its symbol as a string
  - :min-fraction-digits - integer, the minimum number of digits allowed in the fraction portion of an amount
  - :min-integer-digits  - integer, the minimum number of digits allowed in the integer portion of an amount
  - :max-fraction-digits - integer, the maximum number of digits allowed in the fraction portion of an amount
  - :max-integer-digits  - integer, the maximum number of digits allowed in the integer portion of an amount
  - :scale               - sets both :min-fraction-digits and :max-fraction digits to the same value.

  When choosing different currency, all parameters of a formatter are initially set
  to that currency. Additionally re-scaling may take place for the amount if scales
  are different.

  The function assigned to the :currency-symbol-fn should take 3 arguments:
  currency, locale and registry.

  It is advised to express locale using a keyword when huge amount of operations is
  expected."
