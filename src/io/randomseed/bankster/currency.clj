  "Gets the localized property of a currency from the given registry and locale. If the

  default locale for the environment will be used. Locale can be expressed as a
  Locale object or any object that can be used to identify the locale (e.g. a keyword
  or a string).

  Localized properties are maps keyed by currency identifiers, containing another
  maps keyed by locale objects. There is a special key :* that contains default
  properties used when there are no properties in locale-keyed maps.

  Let's take a hypothetical entry of a registry database `.cur-id->localized`:

  ```clojure
  {:XXX {#object[java.util.Locale 0x3f5af72f \"en_US\"] {:symbol \"$\"}}
        {#object[java.util.Locale 0x3f5af72f \"en\"]    {:symbol \"X$\"}
        {:* {:symbol \"ABC\"}}
  ```

  * Calling `(localized-property :symbol :XXX :en_US)` will return `$`.
  * Calling `(localized-property :symbol :XXX :en_GB)` will return `X$`.
  * Calling `(localized-property :symbol :XXX :pl_PL)` will return `ABC`.

  The first is self-explanatory.

  The second falls back to `en` because the function will re-try the language
  part (`en`) alone when the property was not found. The same method is repeatedly
  applied to other components of a locale (variant, script and extensionsÂ â€“ if
  any). So for the locale identified by `th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai` the following keys will
  be tried:

  - `th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai`,
  - `th_TH_TH_#u-nu`,
  - `th_TH_TH_#u`,
  - `th_TH_TH`,
  - 0`th_TH` and `th`.

  The third example renders `ABC` because there is an entry of `:symbol` in the
  default properties map under the key `:*`.

  Please note that functions for getting particular properties may apply additional
  steps to obtain them. For instance, the display-name function will first call the
  localized-property and if it fails it will fall back to Java methods (if the
  currency is ISO-standardized). If that will fail too then it will return a
  short-code of a currency."
